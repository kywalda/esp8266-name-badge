# esp8266-name-badge
A esp8266-name-badge project - easy to change - with a HD44780 compatible display (arduino environment)

With this project I'm trying to use an esp8266-nodemcu as controller for a name badge application.

* uses the eeprom of the esp for storing the latest text
* uses the esp as accesspoint with captive portal to make it easy to connect to the device
* scrolls the text from last line/ last character to upper left to make reading comfortable (currently only 2 line displays)

In the new version added 4 PWM-outputs to fade 4 series of LEDs in a sequence. They are controlled by an os-timer interrupt
